# LC Admins Quorum
On any Vote of the LC Admins, if fewer than one half of all Admins respond to the question, then approval of that question is stayed. This is regardless of the kind of Vote, except for a Referendum Vote.

An admin who abstains may be considered not to have responded in the following circumstances:
* If the Admin is considered to have abstained from the vote by any rule or precedent of governance, they are considered to not have responded, regardless of whether they otherwise respond to the motion,
* If the Admin abstains for an identified or a perceived conflict of interest and identifies this conflict of interested as the reason for abstaining.

For greater certainty, an admin is considered to have responded to any motion in which they approve (including conditionally), deny, or abstain filing a conditional dissent, and may be considered to have responded to any motion which they have abstained for any reason other than the above identified reasons.

Additionally, if, on any Vote of the LC Admins, fewer than one half of those responding to the question approve, then approval of that question is abstained.

On any vote that approval is stayed, the action is not considered to be approved, and the vote may not enter a final comment period while such a stay is in effect on that vote.

## Substitution of Admin Votes

If, on any action before the Admins, it is impossible, or unreasonably difficult for a Quorum to approve the Action in a reasonable period of time, due to conflicts of interest or unavailable or incapacitated admins, then a vote of the admins, which is of the same kind as the original action, except that it is not subject to the requirements of this rule, may designated a group of Members which shall have the authority to decide the question as if that group were considered the admins for that specific action.

A group designated for this purpose shall be at least as Numerous as the Admins.

## Applicability of this Rule

This Rule does not apply to any Team of the Admins unless they may explicitly adopt this Rule or a modified version thereof.
