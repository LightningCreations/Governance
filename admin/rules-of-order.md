# LC Admins Rules of Order and Governance Procedures

## Declaration of Role of the Admins

The Role of the Admins is to ensure Order and Good Governance of Lightning Creations in the trust and good reasoning of the Project Members and Community Members.

## Declaration of Role of Governance

This document was created in response to a multitude of disagreements over precedential rules. It, however, shall not be considered as a substitute for precedent. Very specifically, these rules and procedures shall be understood as the written source of truth and the fallback guidance. If a precedent exists for an action being taken, that precedent takes priority over this document.

## Public Decision Making Preferred

The Admins of Lightning Creations shall, in the furthurance of the stated goal, prefer to make all decisions publiclly, in a manner that is available for the review and comment of all project members and project leads of Lightning Creations, and it shall be presumed that the whole of Lightning Creations benefits from a decision being made publically.

The above presumption may be defeated only on clear and convincing evidence that a private decision is either necessary, or the interests of the whole of Lightning Creations demand a private decision.

With the exception of a Referendum Vote, which necessarily must be held in public, the method of voting used does not affect whether a decision may be made privately.

## Voting Methods

There are multiple methods to conduct certain votes. Unless otherwise specified, the admin making a motion may define which voting method is used.

### Majority Vote

A Majority Admin Vote may be taken for most changes to Lightning Creations. All admins must acknowledge and respond to the vote, or a sufficient number must respond to guarantee a majority. After both the required number of admins have responded and a majority vote is obtained, a 24-hour comment period occurs, after which a majority of the voting admins must have voted in favour, where any admin who did not vote is considered to have abstained.
In the case of a private decision, the comment period may be waived once a majority has been achieved provided no admin objects to the waiver.


### Unanimous Votes

A Unanimous Admin Vote may be taken for especially dangerous, irreversible, or sensitive decisions that cannot be taken lightly. 

All admins must acknowledge and have responded in favour or abstained. After all admins hvae acknowledged and all voting admins are in favour, a 24-hour comment period occurs, after which all voting admins must remain in favour. 
In the case of a private decision, the comment period may be waived once a majority has been achieved provided no admin objects to the waiver.
If any admin objects to the action, the vote fails. 

### Referendum Votes

A referendum vote is taken among some defined group of the general membership, which may be the project leads, project members, or the entire community members. Which group is chosen to take the vote is set by the Admin making the motion.

Referendum Votes may be set at a majority, a special majority (2/3s of the defined group), or a unanimous vote. The required threshold is set by the Admin making the motion.

In either case, the process is the same as a Majority Admin vote or a Unanimous Admin Vote, except that the target group is considered, not the admins, and for a special majority vote, two thirds of the voting group must be in favour. 

### Extended Final Comment Periods

For all votes held publically, any admin may make separate admin motion to require a final comment period longer than 24 hours. Any Admin vote may be used, and the period may be any length of time.
The final comment period for a moton to require an extended final comment period may be waived, provided no admin objects. 

If an Extended Final Comment Period is used, final votes are checked at the end of the specified period of time, rather than 24 hours, and the vote is otherwise conducted as usual. 

A motion to require an Extended Final Comment Period may be placed at any time prior to ending the final comment period. 

### Conditional Approval

Any Admin may place a condition on their approval of a particular motion, such that their approval is only considered if the condition is met. 

### Formal Dissents

When abstaining or conditionally approving a vote, any admin (or in the case of a Referendum Vote, any member of the voting group) may lodge a formal dissent, and explain the reason therefore. A Formal Dissent does not block a motion, even one requiring a unanimous vote, but provides reasons that the admin believes the action should not be taken. 

A Formal Dissent may be for a procedural reason, that the procedures surrounding taking the action were incorrect or some other process should have happened first, or substantive, that the action itself is unnecessary, harmful, or unsound. 

A Formal Dissent may be used by a decision maker to back off of a conflict in posititions that effectively deadlock the LC procedures. 


## Specific Voting Requiremens

Certain actions require specific kinds of votes, and the admin making the motion must conduct the specified kind of vote for the action
