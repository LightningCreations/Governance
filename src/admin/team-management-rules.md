# LC Team Management Rules

## Team Membership

New members may be appointed to a team by vote of the admins, with the consent of the team, which is granted by a Unanimous Team Vote, unless the team may specify a different mechanism to give such consent. Any admin vote may be used for this purpose.

Team Members may be removed from a team by a vote of the admins, with the consent of the team, which is granted by a Unanimous Team Vote, unless the team may specify a different mechanism to give such consent. In all cases, the particular member shall be excluded from the vote and is considered to have abstained. Any admin vote may be used for this purpose.

The Admins may, in extraordinary circumstances, appoint new members to a team or remove members from a team without the consent of the team. Such extraordinary circumstances may be if the member to be removed is unable to carry out their duties as a team member in a manner compatible with the interests of Lightning Creations and the team does not or cannot act to allow the removal. Additionally, it may be used to add emergency stand-in members if multiple team members become incapacitated, such that the team is rendered unable to make decisions. Such alterations may be made only with a Unanimous Admin Vote.

## Subteams/Committees/Groups

Each Team, other than the LC Management Team, may create subteams, committees, or other groups for decision making purposes with the approval of the LC Management Team.

The LC Management Team may create subteams, committees, or groups for decision making purposes with the approval of the Admins.

## Establishment of New Teams

The LC Admins may establish a new team covering a distinct domain of responsibility with the consent of the LC Management and Vision Casting teams.

The LC Admins shall not establish any group other than a team for the purposes of decision making, except that the establishment of a Board for the whole of LC under the "Creating the Company" project shall be permissible upon the execution of that project. 

The LC Admins shall not establish a new team covering an existing domain of responsibility, or a portion thereof, without the consent of the team under that domain, in addition to the consent of the LC Management and Vision Casting teams. The division of responsibility between the two teams shall be clearly spelled out and approved by the Team in question, the LC Management Team, and the Vision Casting Team.

The abolition of a team shall be only by amendment to governance approved by a unanimous vote of both the LC Management Team and Vision Casting Team, and shall only take place in extraordinary circumstances.
