# Separation of LC Admin Authorities and Responsibilities

## Domains of Responsibility

It is currently assumed and hereby declared that the LC Admins are responsible for and have supreme authority over 5 primary domains of LC's Operations:

1. Vision Casting: This team is responsible for determining the direction of LC in general. More specifically, it describes the purpose of LC and sets broad future goals, as well as describing some specific/immediate goals, which the remaining teams and project leads will carry out.
2. LC Management: This team is responsible for, in following the ideals of the Vision Casting team, direct LC itself to success. As part of this, it manages membership, inter-team and LC-wide governance, the charters of ILM projects, and the CtC project.
3. Project Management: This team is responsible for, in following the ideals of the Vision Casting team, directing the projects of LC and allocating LC's resources to projects. As part of this, it approves and triages projects, assigns project leads, and to some extent manages allocating people to projects.
4. Server Management and Maintenance: This team is responsible for, in following the ideals of the Vision Casting Team, creating and maintaining the server as well as setting top-level regulation of the server membership.
5. Server Moderation: This team is responsible for, in following the ideals of the Vision Casting Team, moderating the server, recruiting new moderators, and setting the conduct of moderation, in addition to managing the moderation toolset.
6. Outreach and Events: This team is reponsible for, in following the ideals of the Vision Casting Team, driving engagement in Lightning Creations by reaching out to potential new members and creating events of various types.

This section shall not be taken to preclude the Admins from holding or assuming authority over any other domain of responsibility. In particular, financial management will remain entirely with the Admins.

## LC Administration Teams

For Each domain of responsibility enumerated above the LC Admins charters and staffs a Team of Trusted Members who volunteer to take on responsibilities in the domain. These teams may include individual admins (but do not include all admins by default). 

Each team shall be tasked with reviewing relevant information and advising the Admins on actions within their domain of responsibility via Motions taken among the membership of the Team. Except as provided for in this or another portion of the Governance, the Teams do not have any direct decision making authority.

Each Team shall make decisions in the same manner in which the Admins may currently do so by the rules or precedents of governance, but they may alter the manners in which they make decisions by Unanimous Vote of the Team, and the Admins may do so as well.

## FCPs may be waived for decisions supported by a Team

Notwithstanding any rule or precedent requiring an FCP, if an action is taken on the advice of a team, which was received by a motion subjected to an FCP, the Admins may waive the FCP when all admins have either approved the motion or abstained explicitly and no Admin has objected to the waiver.

This rule shall not apply if:

1. Any Admin has Abstained or Conditionally approved and, as part of that action, filed a conditional dissent, unless the admin explicitly consents to the waiver,
2. The Motion for which this rule is applied was taken in public, and the motion by the team was not a publicly visible motion.

Nothing in this section shall be taken to preclude the Admins from waiving an FCP in any manner already permitted by any rule or precedent.

## Server Maintenance Actions Joint with Admins and Server Maintenance Team

Without prejudice to any other person so authorized, a Member of the Server Maintenance Team or any Admin may take any action classified as a Server Maintenance Action, if the action receives a second by the Server Maintenance Team.

The Admins may by a Majority Admin Vote deprive the Server Maintenance Team of this authority with respect to a particular action or group of actions.

## Future Vesting of Authority

Not earlier than 1 year after this amendment is adopted, the Admins may, by Unanimous Admin Vote, vest all authority of the domains of responsibility in the teams constructed for that purpose, with the consent of each team given by 2/3s majority, or may vest a limited set of authorities within the domain. 

Nothing in this section shall preclude the Admins from amending this or any other portion of Governance with a Unanimous Admin Vote.
