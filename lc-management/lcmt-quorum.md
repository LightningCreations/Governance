# LC Management Team Quorum
On any Vote of the LC Management Team, if fewer than one half of all Members therein respond to the question, then approval of that question is stayed. This is regardless of the kind of Vote, except for a Referendum Vote.

A Member of the Team who abstains may be considered not to have responded in the following circumstances:

* If the Member is considered to have abstained from the vote by any rule or precedent of governance, whether it be of the team's Governance or the Governance of LC as a whole, they are considered to not have responded, regardless of whether they otherwise respond to the motion,
* If the Member abstains for an identified or a perceived conflict of interest and identifies this conflict of interested as the reason for abstaining.
For greater certainty, a member is considered to have responded to any motion in which they approve (including conditionally), deny, or abstain filing a conditional dissent, and may be considered to have responded to any motion which they have abstained for any reason other than the above identified reasons.

Additionally, if, on any Vote of the LC Management Team, fewer than one half of those responding to the question approve, then approval of that question is stayed.

On any vote that approval is stayed, the action is not considered to be approved, and the vote may not enter a final comment period while such a stay is in effect on that vote.

## Meetings

The LC Management Team may hold meetings when sufficient members therein are present to constitute a quorum by the above rule. All members not present for a particular meeting are considered not to have responded to any vote presented to the team at that meeting, in addition to any of the above cases.

A meeeting of the LC Management Team may not be convened absent a quorum to do so.

## Applicability

This Rule shall apply to the LC Management Team only and shall not be taken to affect votes taken by any other team or meetings held by any other team, even if more than one team is voting on that question or is present (including if the LC Management Team is one of those teams).
