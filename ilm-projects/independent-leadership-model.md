# LC Project Independent Leadership Model

## Project Models

By default, all projects are run by some lead or leads, appointed by the LC Admins, who makes decisions, but the LC Admins retain administrative authority and the power to make changes to the project. The Admins also enforce the LC Rules and any code of conduct upon regular projects, and manage the repositories used by the project. Members of these projects are typically assigned from the Membership of LC, who are all approved by administrative action.

The exception to these are "Independent Leadership Model" projects, which assume some or typically all of the authorities normally laid with the Admins. Such Projects may be created when the LC Admins agree that a project has or is likely to, by its design or nature, exceed the scope of a regular LC Project such that it demands active administration by its Leads. 

## Independent Leadership Model Project Charter

Each Independent Leadership Model Project shall be created in combination with a Charter that spells out the authorities and responsibilities of the Project Leads. The Charter must be approved by a Unanimous Admin Vote, and then ratified by the Project Leads, who may return it instead with suggested changes, and the new charter must be approved by Unanimous Admin Vote and then presented to the Project Leads. 

The Charter may be amended by a Unanimous Admin Vote by and with the consent of the Project Leads. It is left to the Project Leads to decide the manner in which they determine and give such consent.

## Intervention of the LC Admins in an Independent Leadership Model Project

The LC Admins should, in general, refrain from interfering in an Independent Leadership Model Project, unless requested to Intervene by the Project Leads or in extraordinary circumstances where the interests of the whole of LC may demand the intervention. Such extraordinary circumstances may be when the Leadership of the Project is dismantled or left in a disfunctional state or when the circumstances exceed the boundaries of the project and impact LC as a whole. 

Project Leads may request intervention when they believe that an ongoing or past situation exceeds their capacity or authority to handle, or the situation affects LC as a whole.
